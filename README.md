# Xmass
Xmass for team

There is a group with 10 members. 
They wants to make a Chtistmas party with a draft.
Everybody tells what they want for Christmas.
They make a box for the presents to hold them.
At the party everybody can pick a random present from the box.
At the end of the party we have to check if the members are happy or not. (Depends on they got what they wanted or not). 
Print for each member.( Example: Susan was happy becouse she/he got "flowers".
				 Jack was not happy becouse she/he got "lipstick".)
